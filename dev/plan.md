# Minimal Template Conversion Plan

## Notes
- User wants to convert the app into a minimal template.
- Only keep index.html and index template in the root and app folder.
- Remove all images and extra HTML files except index/index template.
- In the app folder, only index.html should remain; delete all others.
- Explored directory structure: index.html found in src, not public/partials.
- Both app/index.html and src/index.html are complex and need to be replaced with a minimal Hello World page.

## Task List
- [ ] Remove all images from the project.
- [ ] Delete all HTML files except index.html and index template in root and app folder.
- [ ] Ensure only index.html remains in the app folder.
- [ ] Replace content with a Hello World start page.

## Current Goal
Remove unnecessary files and create Hello World page.
