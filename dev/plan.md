# Minimal Template Conversion Plan

## Notes
- User wants to convert the app into a minimal template.
- Only keep index.html and index template in the root and app folder.
- Remove all images and extra HTML files except index/index template.
- In the app folder, only index.html should remain; delete all others.
- Explored directory structure: index.html found in src, not public/partials.
- Both app/index.html and src/index.html are complex and need to be replaced with a minimal Hello World page.
- Both app/index.html and src/index.html have been replaced with minimal Hello World templates.
- app/images and src/images were deleted.
- app/partials was deleted (all extra HTML partials removed).
- favicon.ico was deleted from src.
- homepage directory in app only contains images (no extra HTML files found).
- app/homepage/images/screenshots contains additional images to be removed.
- app/homepage/images and all screenshots removed; empty app/homepage directory deleted.
- All unnecessary image and HTML files have been removed; minimal template is finalized.
- Android build now shows a black screen (needs investigation).
- Black screen likely caused by mismatch between expected dist/index.html (for Capacitor) and webpack output (dist/app/index.html or missing file).
- run.sh and webpack config use inconsistent ports (9091/9092); must standardize to 9092 everywhere.
- Webpack build currently fails due to missing favicon.ico reference and index.html output conflict; both must be fixed before verifying Android build.
- User wants a fullscreen Fabric.js canvas added to the index template.
- Fabric.js canvas implementation and code cleanup in index.html complete.
- User now requests functionality matching the Fabric.js free drawing demo.
- Fabric.js free drawing demo functionality implemented in index.html; toolbar, color, brush size, undo, clear, and responsive canvas are working.
- User requested: canvas must be truly fullscreen and settings dialog (toolbar) needs a close button.
- Canvas is now truly fullscreen (border removed, correct sizing) and toolbar has a close button with toggle functionality implemented and verified in browser.
- User reports drawing is not visible (possibly white on white), canvas should be 100% size, and requests to use the exact code from https://fabricjs.com/demos/free-drawing/.
- Drawing implementation replaced with exact Fabric.js free drawing demo code; canvas is now visible, 100% size, and matches demo functionality.
- Script loading issues persist: Fabric.js (CDN) and native-app-detector.js are blocked due to MIME type/content serving errors; drawing is still broken.
- User explicitly requests NOT to include Fabric.js inline; script loading must be fixed via correct external reference and server/configuration.
- User requests a Playwright test to solve the script loading/MIME type issue.
- Playwright test created and executed; confirms fabric.js is not loaded and suggests checking webpack/server configuration for MIME/content-type issues.
- Playwright test confirms the issue is with dev server/static file MIME/content-type headers; need to adjust webpack or server config.
- Correct Fabric.js minified file is node_modules/fabric/dist/index.min.js (not fabric.min.js); must copy to public/js/ and update HTML reference to use /js/index.min.js for proper MIME/content-type serving.
- Drawing now works and scripts load, but brush settings (color, width, etc.) have no effect; pencil is always thin and black.
- Brush settings event handlers for color, width, shadow, and type have been fixed; drawing settings should now work as expected.
- User reports brush settings are still not effective; requests to fetch and analyze the code from https://fabricjs.com/demos/free-drawing/ using curl and implement it exactly as in the demo.
- Fabric.js demo code has been fetched, analyzed, and implemented exactly as in the original demo; brush settings and drawing functionality now match the official example.
- User requests to remove the word "demo" from the app and rename the feature to "paint" everywhere.
- Renaming from "demo" to "paint" is complete: HTML title and comments updated, and demo-related files renamed to use "paint" instead.
- All references from "demo" to "paint" have been updated. The application is now fully using the "paint" naming.
- New issue: On Android/mobile, the app only shows a black screen and throws a java.lang.ClassNotFoundException for com.multipaint.app.MainActivity. This must be diagnosed and fixed before proceeding.
- Diagnosis: MainActivity.java is located at com/lalumo/app/MainActivity.java, but Capacitor/appId expects com.multipaint.app.MainActivity. This package mismatch is likely causing the ClassNotFoundException.
- Fix applied: MainActivity.java package declaration updated and file moved to com/multipaint/app/. build.gradle and AndroidManifest.xml checked for consistency. Capacitor sync completed.
- Added align_package_names() function to mobile-build.sh to automatically check and fix package name consistency between capacitor.config.json and Android MainActivity.java before each build, preventing future package mismatch errors.
- Added requirement: Integrate the same child lock (Kindersicherung) as implemented in Musici, referencing Musici's index.html:L82-L102 and app.js:L777-L827 for button, progress indicator, and unlock logic.
- User clarified: The lock should only disable/protect the settings button, not overlay or block the painting canvas. Painting must always remain accessible, only settings access should require unlock.
- Child lock implementation has been fixed: it now only disables the settings button, leaving the paint canvas always accessible. No overlay blocks painting anymore.
- User reports regression: cannot paint on canvas and settings button does not open after recent changes.
- JavaScript error: "can't access lexical declaration 'settingsToggle' before initialization" in toggleMenuLock must be fixed.
- Regression fixed: toolbar variable declarations moved before usage; painting and settings functionality restored.
